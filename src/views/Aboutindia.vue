          MY INDIA IS MY PRIDE
        </h3>
        <p class="article">
          India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a
          kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage, for more than
          <strong>4000 years</strong>. It has reached to a point of all-round
          socio-economic stability during the last <strong>65 years</strong> of
          its Independence. India, a union of states, is a Sovereign, Secular,
          and Democratic Republic with a Parliamentary system of Governance.<br /><br />
          There are <strong>29 states and 7 Union territories</strong> in the
          country. From the largest to the smallest, each State/UT of India is
          unique in it’s - demography, history and culture, dress, festivals,
          language etc.<br /><br />
          The history of nation gives glimpses into the magnanimity of its
          evolution – from a country under British colonialism, to one of the
          leading economies in the world, all within a span of just sixty years.
          More than anything the nationalistic fervour of the people is the
          contributing force behind the culmination of such a development. This
          transformation of the nation instils a sense of national pride in the
          heart of every Indian within country, and this section is a modest
          attempt at keeping its flame alive.<br /><br />
