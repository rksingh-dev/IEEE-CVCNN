            National Institute of Technology Raipur (Formerly Government Engineering College Raipur), situated in the capital of a newly Incepted state of Chhattisgarh, has proven to be "avant-grade' in the field of science and technology over past few decades in this region. With sweet memory of foundation ceremony by our President Hon'ble Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 14th September 1956, the institute started with two departments namely Metallurgical and Mining Engineering. Later the inauguration of the Institute building was done by our Prime Minister Hon'ble Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru on 14th March 1963. From 1st December 2005, the institute has become the National Institute of Technology. The institution has grown in tandem with the major surrounding industries â€“ The Bhilai Steel Plant, SECL BALCO and NTPC Korba. It currently offers 12 Undergraduate and 6 Postgraduate courses including MCA and M.Tech in Applied Geology.

            ICPC<sup>2</sup>T is organized by National Institute of Technology Raipur and technically co-sponsored by IEEE Madhya Pradesh Section, IEEE Student Section NIT Raipur, IES Chapter IEEE MP Section and PELS Chapter IEEE MP Section. ICPC<sup>2</sup>T will give a chance to the students, academicians, researchers, scientists and practicing engineers to have a platform for potential knowledge exchange on recent trends, theories and practices of Power Systems, Power Electronics, Machine Drives, Control Systems and Computational Technologies. Particularly, emphasis will be placed on promotion of new and renewable sources of power, Smart Grid and related cyber-physical systems. Applications of data analytics to power systems, such as demand response and demand side management will be considered. Finally, the innovative use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning and data visualization approaches for the power management in a variety of contexts including efficient network management, improved situational awareness and anomaly detection will be of interest. ICPC<sup>2</sup>T features invited talks and Keynote address from eminent professors/scientists from across the world, pre-conference workshops/tutorials from active engineers and technical paper presentation of the participants from different parts of the world.
